# my_world
This is me creating my hello-world git repo on github

Proper introduction time.. 
I'm Philomena Obasi, resident of Lagos State, student of the University of Benin, Edo State. 
I'm an aspiring front-end engineer with little skills and great love (and will) for learning, though a bit shy. 
I also love to read books and make new friends, so let's hangout sometime, lol.
